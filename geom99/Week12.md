## Task num Update Survey on Survey 123 [03/28/24 30 mins]

After working with the Survey123 webhook for microsoft flow, I realized that certain features may be more accessible depending on the datatype. I want to be able to extract the lat and long from the locaation point. With the location saved as an esripointz type, I cannot access it using flow. Additionally I want to allow for photo attachments.
