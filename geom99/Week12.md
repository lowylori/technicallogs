## Task num Update Survey on Survey 123 [03/28/24 30 mins]

After working with the Survey123 webhook for microsoft flow, I realized that certain features may be more accessible depending on the datatype. I want to be able to extract the lat and long from the locaation point. With the location saved as an esripointz type, I cannot access it using flow. Additionally I want to allow for photo attachments.

* Current survey:

### Modify the survey

* Open survey in Survery123 Connect
* modify the XLS Form to do the following
  * capture x, y, z of the geopoint in seperate columns to allow the data to be accessed by variable in Flow
  * created an image attachment field
  * changed the dataype for priority level to be an esriFieldTypeInterger, instead of string (previous mistake)
  * set 'General Inspection' to be the default value for reqType for language barriers in the event that the individual skips the question
