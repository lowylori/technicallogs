## Report generation with ArcGIS API for Python [04/04/24 60 mins]

We want to automate report generation as a scheduled task in jupyter notebook. First we have to create the notebook that accesses the survey using the item id, choose a report template and generate as a pdf. Then we will look into the steps to make this an scheduled task.

* Sign into AGOL account
* If you don't have a pre-existing survey, you will need to create one. I will be using the Parks and Grounds Request form from the Solution.
* Find the Item in AGOL content
* CLick top right, Manage in Survey123 website
