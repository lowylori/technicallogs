## Report generation with ArcGIS API for Python [04/04/24 60 mins]

We want to automate report generation as a scheduled task in jupyter notebook. First we have to create the notebook that accesses the survey using the item id, choose a report template and generate as a pdf. Then we will look into the steps to make this an scheduled task.

* Sign into AGOL account
* If you don't have a pre-existing survey, you will need to create one. I will be using the Parks and Grounds Request form from the Solution.
* Find the Item in AGOL content
* CLick top right, Manage in Survey123 website

* Under the data tab, select the report option. A panel will open up on the right, and there is an option to select a template. * Click Manage Template

* You can download a sample template, make modifications in Microsoft word, then upload them as a new template. We can go back to this step later to format the perfect report - for now, I will just senerate a sample template summary, which will give a general overview of the most recent entries.
* This is what it looks like in word
