## Map out the structure of our web solution [03/05/24 30mins]

Created a flow chart to better understand the stucture of our web solution. The chart suffered several iterations and is still being developed. The idea was to understand how the various components of this solution will interact with eachother, and what AGOL apps can accomodate our business needs. See Figure below.
