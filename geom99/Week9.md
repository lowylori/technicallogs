## Map out the structure of our web solution [03/05/24 30 mins]

Created a flow chart to better understand the stucture of our web solution. The chart suffered several iterations and is still being developed. The idea was to understand how the various components of this solution will interact with eachother, and what AGOL apps can accomodate our business needs. See Figure below.

## Explore AGOL Solutions [03/07/24 30 mins]

Spent some time browsing through various AGOL solutions and seeing which ones were a good fit. Read the description and looked into the software that each solution utilized. Narrowed down to the following three options:
1. Parks and Ground Management
2. Citizen Problem Reporter
3. Conservation Easement Monitering

## Parks and Ground Management Solution [03/10/24 30 mins]

Watched the 20 min overview of the solution and read through the documentation. I came up with the following pro's and con's from this process.

Pros:
	• Can submit both public and internal requests (forms are via survey123)
	• Connected to field maps and has an active inventory for the ground
	• Management center contains an intuitive dashboard that allows you to view open requests and unassigned work
	• You can create assignments directly from the management center and assign a task to maintenance staff
	• Park assignments - video did not cover the maintenance assignment side of this solution -need to know more
		○ Uses workforce to assign tasks
		○ Workers receive the task and update it when its complete

Cons:
	• Generating reports -  not a feature
	• Many layers to this solution, however, may be too complex  for the client.
