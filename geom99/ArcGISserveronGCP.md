## Log in to Remote Desktop and Shut down a VM [03/07/24 5 mins]

Log in to Remote Desktio:
* From console.cloud.google go to Computing Engine> VM instances. Click the three dots on the far right for your VM and select start.
* once the VM is started, a new External IP will be generated. Copy this IP.
* From the windows start menu, search remote desktop. Open the application.
* paste your external ip address in, colon, port # (444)
* this will prompt for a username and password.

## Publish a map service into your ArcGIS Server on your GCP VM

* Start your VM instance. Ensure your VM is running for the duration of this workflow. If the server is offline, you will not be able to publish
* Open ArcGIS Pro
* Create a map using a copy of the Canada.shp file which is also stored on the VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you know the location (filepath) of this file on your local computer and on your VM.

* Style the shapefile to suite your needs.
* Save Project
* Add new server connection by going to the insert panel along the top bar, selection the connections drop down
